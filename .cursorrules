# Cursor Rules for Arch Decision Maker

## Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)

### Core Testing Principle
**EVERY feature implementation MUST be followed by running tests. No exceptions.**

### Test-First Development Rules
1. **Before implementing any new feature:**
   - Write tests first (TDD approach preferred)
   - If tests don't exist for the area you're modifying, create them
   - Ensure existing tests pass before making changes

2. **After implementing any feature:**
   - Run `npm test` to execute all tests
   - Ensure all tests pass before considering the feature complete
   - If tests fail, fix the implementation, don't modify tests to pass
   - Add new tests to cover the new functionality
