# üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision Maker

A React 19 + Vite tool for visualizing architecture decisions from YAML files. This tool allows you to define architecture decision trees with dependencies, visualize them as interactive diagrams, and explore detailed information about each decision point.

## Features

- **üìù YAML Configuration**: Define decision trees using simple YAML syntax
- **üå≥ Interactive Visualization**: View decisions as a connected tree diagram
- **üîó Dependency Management**: Model dependencies between decisions
- **üîó External Dependencies**: Track external blockers with expected resolution dates
- **‚öñÔ∏è Pros & Cons Analysis**: Evaluate decisions with rated pros and cons (1-5 scale)
- **üìã Detailed Views**: Rich descriptions with Markdown support
- **üé® Draw.io Integration**: Link to external architecture diagrams
- **‚úÖ Validation**: Built-in validation for decision tree consistency
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Overdue Tracking**: Visual indicators for overdue external dependencies
- **‚≠ê Rating System**: Star-based rating system for pros and cons analysis
- **üéØ Path Selection**: Mark decision paths as selected (green) or rejected (red) for clear visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd arch-decision-maker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests once
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (default)
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

- **Unit tests** for utility functions (YAML parsing, validation)
- **Component tests** for React components (YamlEditor, DecisionDetails)
- **Integration tests** for the main App component
- **Type tests** to validate TypeScript interfaces

All core functionality is tested to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

## YAML Format

The tool uses a specific YAML format to define architecture decision trees:

```yaml
name: "Your Architecture Decision Tree Name"
description: "Optional description of the decision tree"
decisions:
  - id: "unique-decision-id"
    title: "Human Readable Title"
    description: |
